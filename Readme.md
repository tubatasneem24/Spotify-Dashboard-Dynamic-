## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes 10 years of personal Spotify listening data to uncover behavioral trends, favorite artists, platform usage, and time-based engagement. With over 13,000 tracks and 12,000+ artists from 2014 to 2024, the dashboard transforms raw listening history into meaningful, interactive insights.
